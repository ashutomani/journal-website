    <h2>Aims & Scope</h2>

    <p>
        Welcome to the <strong>Journal of Applied and Integrative Biology (JAIB)</strong>. 
        JIB is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal dedicated to fostering innovative
        research across the spectrum of life sciences. As a multidisciplinary platform,
        JIB encourages the integration of knowledge from diverse fields to enhance
        understanding of biological systems in their complexity, from molecular to
        ecological scales.
    </p>

    <p>
        JAIB publishes articles <strong>only in the English language</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        At JAIB, we aim to provide a platform for scientists, researchers, and scholars
        to share high-quality research that pushes the boundaries of biology. By
        connecting various disciplines, we promote holistic approaches to understanding
        life in all its forms, exploring how biological processes interrelate and
        intersect with allied fields such as biotechnology, environmental sciences,
        and computational biology.
    </p>

    <h3>Scope</h3>

    <p>
        The Journal of Applied and Integrative Biology welcomes submissions from a wide range of
        life science disciplines, including but not limited to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Molecular Biology</li>
        <li>Genetics, Genomics and Proteomics</li>
        <li>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</li>
        <li>Microbiology and Immunology</li>
        <li>Biochemistry and Structural Biology</li>
        <li>Systems Biology</li>
        <li>Neurobiology and Behavior</li>
        <li>Biotechnology and Bioengineering</li>
        <li>Environmental and Conservation Biology</li>
        <li>Computational Biology and Bioinformatics</li>

        <li>Medical Biotechnology</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We are particularly interested in studies that bridge gaps between different
        areas, foster new collaborations, or present novel methodologies for solving
        complex biological problems.
